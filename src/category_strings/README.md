# String Analysis

## Data from top 3 resources (CTCI, EPI, Leetcode)

I cannot share the exact questions in each of these resources without infringing on their copyright.

However, I can share a chart of my analysis on the nuance and techniques taught in these resources.

***The nuance and technique around Strings***

- CTCI Q1: `boolean array`
- CTCI Q2: `pre-sort string`, `int array`
- CTCI Q3: `working backwards`, `two scan`
- CTCI Q4: `int array`, `bit vector`
- CTCI Q5: `N/A`
- CTCI Q6: `string builder`
- CTCI Q7: `double the string`

- EPI Q1: `string builder`
- EPI Q2: `N/A`
- EPI Q3: `N/A`
- EPI Q4: `two scan`
- EPI Q5: `two pointer`
- EPI Q6: `pre-reverse string`
- EPI Q7: `N/A`
- EPI Q8: `nested loops`
- EPI Q9: `work backwards`
- EPI Q10: `N/A`
- EPI Q11: `string builder`
- EPI Q12: `linear time string matching`

- Leetcode Q1: `N/A`
- Leetcode Q2: `linear time string matching`
- Leetcode Q3: `N/A`
- Leetcode Q4: `two scan`, `string builder`
- Leetcode Q5: `N/A`
- Leetcode Q6: `N/A`
- Leetcode Q7: `linear time string matching`
- Leetcode Q8: `N/A`
- Leetcode Q9-Q22: `N/A: Will be covered in future categories`

## Conclusion

From these resources, we can compose a list of all the core concepts and common nuance that one would need to understand in order to master questions around Strings.

1. `two scan`
2. `two pointer`
3. `work backwards`
4. `int array`
5. `bool array`
6. `bit vector`
7. `pre-sort`
8. `pre-reverse`
9. `string builder`
10. `double string`
11. `linear time string matching`

Going one level deeper, what must one know in order to understand how to use the above techniques/nuance?

I have compiled a list and will go over these in detail in one of my videos!

1. `String Builder Class`
2. `Character Class`
3. `String Class`
4. `ASCII vs Unicode`

## Next Steps

I have created and shared the minimum set of questions in this folder that capture all above techniques with strings! 

The questions are available in the three most popular programming languages for interviews: python, java, and javascript.

I have also shared a free online coding environment for you to test your changes! https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/RobZuazua/CrashCode/tree/master/src
