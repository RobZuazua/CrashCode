I built Crash Code to inspire all of us to master the technical coding interview.

Why? Because the coding interview is often a hurdle that holds us back from reaching our ultimate potential.

Once we have mastered it, we gain new possibilities.

###  Training

1. I have identified every core concept, common nuance & technicality of every category of questions. (See the data in each category's README)

2. I have created this REPO that contains the minimum set of questions that capture the totality of common nuance for every category of question, and i have shared a 1-click coding environment for you to easily train: https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/RobZuazua/CrashCode

3. I have daily office hours for chatting or answering any questions: https://discord.gg/e56GWrU
