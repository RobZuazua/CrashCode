# Mastering the Technical Interview

## Why

My life centers around ***understanding***.

I am bringing that search for understanding to the technical coding interview.

I ask and refine: ***What must one do to master the technical coding interview in the quickest possible way without producing negative side effects like stress and anxiety?***.

It is not about how many hours you put in. But it is about your depth of understanding.

## How it Works

To master the technical coding interview, one must:

1. Truly understand every concept around data structures and algorithms.
2. Be exposed to all the nuance and technique around these data structures and algorithms.
3. Be a proficient coder.

In order to speed up this process for others, I have:

1. Analyzed over 200 interview questions on leetcode and glassdoor.
2. Analyzed every single question in CTCI and EPI.
3. Identified every core concept and common nuance / technicality of every category of questions from Strings to Dynamic Programming.
4. Created the minimum set of questions that capture the totality of common nuance for every Category of Questions.
5. Provided a free online coding environment for you to easily write code and run tests online.
