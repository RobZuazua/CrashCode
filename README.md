### Question: What is Crash Code and why did you create it?

I built Crash Code to help us master the technical coding interview in the most effective way possible.

Mastering the technical interview opens doors and has the ability to transform our lives.

### Question: How do I master the technical interview?

Sincerity, seriousness, and understanding.

### Question: I am serious and I genuinely seek to master the coding interview in order to open doors in my life. What must be understood?

To master the coding interview, one must:

1. Intuitively understand the recurring concepts.

2. Become a proficient coder.

3. Train your perceptions.

### Question: What are the required concepts and how do I most effectively understand them?

I have been analyzing every question in the top 4 code prep resources (CTCI, EPI, top 100 Leetcode, and hundreds in glassdoor) and I have been sharing my analysis in this repo, ex: https://github.com/RobZuazua/CrashCode/blob/master/src/category_strings/README.md

Based on this work, I have created and shared the minimum set of questions that capture the totality of common concept, technique, and nuance for every category of questions from Strings to Dynamic Programming.

To most effectively understand every required concept, you must come to a working solution using every concept yourself.

In this repo, you have the minimum set of questions that cover all the concepts. Work through them.

If you get stuck on any question for more than a few minutes, move on and come to my daily office hours where I will provide light guidance. 

Additionally each question has a hint that links the question to the concept. You may use the hint and watch the linked youtube video to intuitively understand the required concept. 

### Question: How do I become a proficient coder?

Exposure. Training. Understanding.

You may use this repository's linked coding environment.

### Question: What is perception training?


### Question: Why don't you share solutions?

If you look at a solution to a question, it is likely you will never fully understand.

I recommend going over all of the category concepts shared on my youtube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4fdhO7egjaKfoJemwD2kIA.

Ask yourself: "Which technique applies to the current question?"

If you are genuinely stuck, you must be gently guided. 

I have daily office hours from 7:30pm-8pm CST for any light guidance: https://discord.gg/e56GWrU
