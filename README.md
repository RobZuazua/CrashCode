# Master the Technical Interview

I made Crash Code to inspire engineers of all backgrounds to master the technical coding interview.

Mastering the interview transforms your life. New opportunities, new coworkers, new friends, and new possibilities.

The truth is simple. To master anything, ***Intuitive understanding > practice***.

### Training 

My passion is to inspire. To show you what it is possible for yourself. To be a friend through your journey. 

1. I have identified every core concept, common nuance & technicality of every category of questions. (See the data in each category's README)

2. I have created this REPO that contains the minimum set of questions that capture the totality of common nuance for every category of question. https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/RobZuazua/CrashCode
