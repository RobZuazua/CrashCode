### Q: What is Crash Code and why did you create it?

I built Crash Code to inspire all of us to master the technical coding interview.

Why? Because the coding interview is often a hurdle that holds us back from reaching our ultimate potential.

Once we have mastered it, we gain new possibilities.

### Q: I am inspired. Now how do I master the interview?

With Understanding. Intutive understanding trumps practice.

My role is to identify everything we need to understand in order to master the coding interview, and provide a light guiding hand.

1. I have coded the minimum set of questions that capture the totality of common concept, technique, and nuance for every category of questions from Strings to Dynamic Programming. (See category READMEs for analysis on every single question in CTCI, EPI, and top 200 Leetcode)

2. I have committed at least 30 minutes of every week day to live office hours for chatting or diving deeper into concepts
