### Question: What is Crash Code?

Crash Code is a training program to help us master the technical coding interview in the most effective way possible.

### Question: Why did you build it?

I built it because technical interview mastery creates opportunities that easily transform our lives.

---

### Question: How do I master the technical interview?

I speak honestly. There is no 5 step plan. It comes down to your level of sincerity, seriousness, and understanding.

### Question: What must be understood?

To master the coding interview, one must:

1. Intuitively understand the recurring concepts.

2. Become a proficient coder. 

3. Train your perceptions. (More on this later)

### Question: What are the required concepts

I have been analyzing every question in the top 4 code prep resources (CTCI, EPI, top 100 Leetcode, and hundreds in glassdoor) and I have been sharing my analysis in this repo, ex: https://github.com/RobZuazua/CrashCode/blob/master/src/category_strings/README.md

Based on this work, I have created and shared the minimum set of questions that capture the totality of common concept, technique, and nuance for every category of questions from Strings to Dynamic Programming.

### Question: How do I most effectively understand these concepts?

To most effectively understand these concepts, you must use each of them to solve a problem entirely on your own.

In this repo, you have the minimum set of questions that cover all the concepts. Work through them without solutions.

If you get stuck on any question for more than a few minutes, move on and come to my daily office hours where I will provide light guidance. 

Additionally each question has a hint that links the question to the concept. You may use the hint and watch the linked youtube video to gain understanding of the required concept.
