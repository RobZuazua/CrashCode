### Question: What is Crash Code?

Crash Code is a training program for mastering the technical coding interview in the most effective way possible.

### Question: Why did you build it?

I am building Crash Code to make devs more effective. Why grind through hundreds of leetcode questions instead of identifying and intuitively understanding every required concept?

---

### Question: How can I master the technical interview?

At the end of the day, it comes down to you. Your level of sincerity, seriousness, and understanding.

### Question: What must be understood?

To master the coding interview, one must:

1. Intuitively understand the recurring concepts.

2. Be a proficient coder. 

3. Train your perceptions. (More on this later)

### Question: What are the recurring concepts

- I analayze every question in the top 4 code prep resources (CTCI, EPI, top 100 Leetcode, and glassdoor.) 

- I identify every common concept, technique, and nuance for each category of questions from Strings to Dynamic Programming.

- I create the minimum set of questions that capture the totality of understanding. 

- I share them freely and provide an online coding environment https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/RobZuazua/CrashCode.

### Question: How do I most effectively understand these concepts?

- To most effectively understand these concepts, you must use each of them to solve a problem entirely on your own.

- In this repo, you have the minimum set of questions that cover all the concepts. Work through them without solutions.

- If you get stuck on any question for more than a few minutes, move on and come to my daily office hours where I will provide light guidance. 

- Additionally each question has a hint that links the question to the concept. You may use the hint and watch the linked youtube video to gain understanding of the required concept.
