### What is Crash Code and why did you create it?

I built Crash Code to help us master the technical coding interview.

Why? Because the coding interview blocks many of us from ever working on something we are passionate about.

Mastering the interview opens doors and has the ability to transform our lives.

### I am inspired. How do I master the interview?

Intuitive understanding and perception training.

I share the minimum set of questions that cover all the understanding one must acquire to master the coding interview.

1. I analyze every question in the top 4 code prep resources (CTCI, EPI, top 100 Leetcode, and hundreds in glassdoor.)

2. I create and share the minimum set of questions that capture the totality of common concept, technique, and nuance for every category of questions from Strings to Dynamic Programming based on my analysis.

3. I commit at least 30 minutes of every weekday to live office hours for answering any questions. 

### Why don't you share solutions?

If you look at a solution to a question, you will never fully understand.

If you are stuck on a question, you must be gently guided to understanding. 

Otherwise, you will sell yourself short.
