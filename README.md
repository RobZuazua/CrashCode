# Mastering the Technical Interview

I made Crash Code to inspire engineers of all backgrounds to master the technical coding interview.

The truth is simple. ***Intuitive understanding > practice***

## Endless Possibilities

Traditional coding interviews remain a major part of evaluation for most companies.

Fortunately, there is but a limited amount of understanding required to pass basically every technical coding interview.

Mastering the technical coding interview opens doors. New coworkers, new friends, new possibilities.

What are you waiting for? 

## Training 

My passion is to inspire you. To show you it is possible. To be your friend through it. 

1. I have identified every core concept, common nuance & technicality of every category of questions. (See findings on each category README)

2. I have coded up and shared a free 1-click online coding environment that contains the minimum set of questions that capture the totality of common nuance for every category of questions. https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/RobZuazua/CrashCode
